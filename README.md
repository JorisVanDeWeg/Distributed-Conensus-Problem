# Consensus Algorithms for Distributed Networks

This repository contains the implementation and results of various consensus algorithms used in distributed networks. These algorithms are designed to ensure efficient and reliable data consistency across multiple interconnected nodes. The project includes implementations of Random Gossip, Random Gossip Random Walk, Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), and the Primal-Dual Method of Multipliers.
